# Most Subscribed Youtube Channels

This data is taken from the KAGGLE dataset library. The data is taken upto the year 2021. 
This data is in the form of csv file which can be easily downloaded and imported to your coding platform. 

## Evaluation of data in different forms:

I used GOOGLE COLAB as a coding platform to interpret and analysis the dataset.
First,I imported the libraries in the project. 
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly are the main libraries which I imported into the project.
uploaded the dataset into the project.
Used coding and analyzed the data through graph models for easy understanding.
Found the categories in the model and established different charts to represent the channel subscription.
Using the seaborn, I was able to represent the data in the form of counterplot, pointplot, barplot, pairplot and heatmap.


##Graphical Representation:

Showcased the data first in counterplot to see the subscribers for each category.

Then, for easy representation I brought in the pie chart using plotly and categorised the channels.

I identified the start year of the Youtube cannels and represented through pointplot.

Next, found the first five most subscribed channels and illustrated through barplot.

I compared the rank,subscribers and started year and demonstrated through the pairplot.

Finally, the heatmap which I used is for understanding the correlation of values using the colour-coding.
